                <p>Welcome to my site. This was previously what scavengers-repo.com was for, but updating it became a huge overhead so looks like I'll be in git pages moving forward. </p>
                <p>About me... I'm just a tech worker in the Bay. I can't really go into the specifics of what I do but I guess you can check out 
                    my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erika-hudiono/">LinkedIn</a> if you're actually into that professional landscape. </p>
                <p>My digital self is more into the artsy, [gaming, comics, anime] scene. I didn't grow up playing games beyond Banjo Tooie and Spyro on my older sister's friend's GameCube 
                    while they snuck off to play Mech Warrior, at least until I got brave enough to buy an XBox in college. It's been mostly PC games in between my dayjob and nightjob
                    but I am proud to say that at least I can afford most of the games I want now including some of the more indie ones :). I don't get a lot of time to play so my _gamerrr skillz_ 
                    are pretty much relegated to casual tier, but I try to at least have one game I play consistently, even if it's just a week. My kid-side tells me
                    that having an ongoing game improves the quality of my work so maybe, just maybe there is some element of truth to that.</p>
