I"–<p>I am Erika Hudiono, an illustrator, programmer, and webcomic author. By day, I help secure web traffic at NASA as a security engineer. Off the clock, I illustrate the Cybernomicon, a collection of various infosec and tech-related notes decorated with my Saturday Morning Soulsborne drawings to make some pretty dry content more exciting.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve used it as a way to organize my various technical hobbies, from cybersecurity, to software engineering, and even some of my HAM Radio attempts make it in. If theyâ€™re willing to learn, tech should be accessible to more people, even if they donâ€™t fall in a neat silo of what people usually think of.</p>
