I"B<p>Some ClipStudio practice with Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to admit I dislike the additional learning curve/workflow with Clipstudio but somehow it just looks a whole lot better for a shorter amount of time put in. Lineart wise for sure I like it a lot more although the simplicity of Procreate is keeping me on the fence unless if I just want to do lineart in ClipStudio</p>
