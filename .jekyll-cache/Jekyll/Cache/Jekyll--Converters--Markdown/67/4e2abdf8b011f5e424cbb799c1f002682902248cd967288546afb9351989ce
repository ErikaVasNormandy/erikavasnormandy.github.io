I"B<p>I work on character design and concept art for tabletop rpgs with my friends, one of which I am using to maintain a webcomic titled Tales From the Leyline Road, a sci-fi series set in the Fragged Empire universe some 10,000 years after humanity s demise. Come for the dramatic space opera, stay for the LoFi vibes.</p>
