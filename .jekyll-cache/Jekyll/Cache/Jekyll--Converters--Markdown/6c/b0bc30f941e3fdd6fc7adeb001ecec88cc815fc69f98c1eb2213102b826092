<h2 id="greeting">Greeting</h2>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/feature1.png" alt="" /></span>
The first three social links that you provide in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file
are listed large in Spectralâ€™s first greeting section, letting folks know
how you most prefer to be contacted.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="pages">Pages</h2>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/feature2a.png" alt="" /></span>
The site comes with some default pages with permalinks: topics, works,
and contacts. If you create your own permalinked pages, they also show
up in the menu.</p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/feature2.png" alt="" /></span>
Unless you specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nolanding</code> in the page header, a link to each of your pages
shows up in the center of the landing page along with the topics and works
pages. Note that the topics and works pages are special, each listing all
the posts that belong to their own respective category.</p>

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="works">Works</h2>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/feature4.png" alt="" /></span>
Each item in your portfolio in the works category is listed in table format
on the works page. Each entry includes a workâ€™s title, excerpt, date of
completion, and demonstrated skillsâ€”items which are also on each workâ€™s
post.</p>

<p class="hws">&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="topics">Topics</h2>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/feature3.png" alt="" /></span>
Each post marked as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">featured</code> is displayed on the front page
in addition to top of the topics listing.</p>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/feature5.png" alt="" /></span>
On the topics page, underneath the featured topics, the topics are listed
by year.</p>

<p>At the top of the siteâ€™s content pages and posts is a navigation breadcrumb.</p>

<!-- <p><img src="/images/feature6.png" alt=""/></p> -->

<p><span class="image fit"><img style="max-width:265px" src="/images/feature6.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/feature6a.png" alt="" /></span>
You can group related topics together into the same category. These grouped
topics are ordered by date as usual but are also provided with Back
and Next links.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="spectral">Spectral</h2>

<p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/feature7a.png" alt="" /></span>
<span class="image left"><img src="/images/feature7b.png" alt="" /></span>
Also included are of course the features that are provided with the awesome
<a href="https://HTML5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> Spectral theme itselfâ€”features
such as text wrapping around pictures and the skel column layout formatting.
For more about the page customization possible with the Spectral layout, see
the <a href="/topics/elements.html">Elements</a> page.</p>
