<p>I was introduced to Jekyll at a <a href="http://www.writethedocs.org/">Write the Docs</a>
meetup and was eager to use it on the ol‚Äô web site, which was definitely in
need of a responsive overhaul. On the <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org">Jekyll themes</a>
site, the <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> designs caught my eye the most.
Even so, none of the Jekyll themes had a menu header that stayed in place while
scrolling, so I browsed HTML5 UP directly and came across the
<a href="https://html5up.net/spectral">Spectral theme</a>.
It was perfect, and so began the Jekyll hack of Spectral to create the site
and repo.</p>

<p>HTML5 UP‚Äôs Spectral is primarily a landing page design with support for a
few pages linked off from the menu. When I posted the first
<a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/spectral/"><em>Jekyll port</em> of Spectral</a>,
I didn‚Äôt add much Jekyll coding for it to be suitable for a blog and
portfolio. After forking my personal site from that original, the intention was
to merge some features back to the original, but it has expanded so much that
a <em>merge</em> will never happen, particularly because there are many who do just
want to use Spectral as a landing page‚Äîchange a few config variables and be
on their way. But, that original port of Spectral is surely in need of a 
little love and should someday at least provide the first two features listed
on the next page. ‚ù§</p>
