I"‰<p>You can find most of my work on Instagram, although Iâ€™m looking to actually start selling prints and other things on Etsy and Redbubble. While I am an amateur barista with mostly onion shaped latte art, with the occasional archery session and am in the process of getting my HAM Radio license, Iâ€™m focusing on the Cybernomicon, Soulsborne Sketches, and Tales From the Leyline Road.</p>
