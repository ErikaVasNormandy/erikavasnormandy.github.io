<p>Scientific Illustrations, Games, Geekery, Web Comics, etc. This site was previously what scavengers-repo was for, but I’ve since moved towards git pages to get rid of the overhead. I am an illustrator and software engineer at NASA. I am based in Night City, aka the Bay Area pre-Cyberpunk. By day, I am usually working with code snippets and network traffic. Obviously I can’t say too many details about it, but that engineering/technical/tinkering midnset has been incredibly useful for many other situations.</p>
