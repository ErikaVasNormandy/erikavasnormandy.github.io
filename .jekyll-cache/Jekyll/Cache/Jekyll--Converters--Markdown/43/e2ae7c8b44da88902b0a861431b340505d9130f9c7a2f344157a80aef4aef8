I"­<p>Iâ€™m entering a Soulsborne art contest! Itâ€™s been amazing to work on these all throughout the year as a consistent activity to do every Saturday. Thanks for watching me, I do have the intention of bringing these to postcard/digital form, thatâ€™s what the Cybernomiconâ€™s for ;) along with webcomics. But until then, which artwork should I pick? Maybe Ranni because itâ€™s been really hot lately and I could use some cooler tones.</p>

<p>Here is me fiddling around with it in Procreate after exporting it. Thankfully I'd just taken a screenshot since it doesn't save without the subscription
