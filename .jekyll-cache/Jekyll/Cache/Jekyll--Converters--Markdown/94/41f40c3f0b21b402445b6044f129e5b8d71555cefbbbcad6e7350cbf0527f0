I"'<p>I’m entering a Soulsborne art contest! It’s been amazing to work on these all throughout the year as a consistent activity to do every Saturday. Thanks for watching me, I do have the intention of bringing these to postcard/digital form, that’s what the Cybernomicon’s for ;) along with webcomics. But until then, which artwork should I pick? Maybe Ranni because it’s been really hot lately and I could use some cooler tones.</p>

<p>Ah Malenia, who didn’t get chills when watching the first trailer for Elden Ring? I am working right now on her rune for some kind of stamp or even tattoo design.</p>
