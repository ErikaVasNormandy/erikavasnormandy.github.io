# Welcome to Jekyll!


# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  title: Hi, Hello, Welcome
  text: I am Erika Hudiono, an illustrator, programmer, and webcomic author. By day, I help secure web traffic at NASA as a security engineer. Off the clock, I illustrate the Cybernomicon, a collection of various infosec and tech-related notes decorated with my Saturday Morning Soulsborne drawings to make some pretty dry content more exciting. I've used it as a way to organize my various technical hobbies, from cybersecurity, to software engineering, and even some of my HAM Radio attempts make it in. I believe tech should be accessible to all, even people who don't fall inline with the traditional image of a tech worker. Heck I didn't even start out in tech, and most people assume I'm more of an arts and crafts type. I also work on character design and concept art for tabletop rpgs with my friends, one of which I am using to maintain a webcomic 
  titled Tales From the Leyline Road, a sci-fi series set in the Fragged Empire universe some 10,000 years after humanity\'s demise. Come for the dramatic space opera, stay for the LoFi vibes.
