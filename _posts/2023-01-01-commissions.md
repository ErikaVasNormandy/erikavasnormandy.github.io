## Commissions

Would you like a custom spellbook page for your story or character? These page fragments are great props for fantasy rpg games or even Call of Cthulhu ones where the Necronomicon is concerned.

  <td>Full Image File(s)</td>
  <td>75 USD</td>
  <td>Photo (capture full layout with natural lighting and staged images) delivered by email from archives@technomancer-01.com. This is the culmination of actually drawing the piece + the labor of actually going out to stage the photos</td>

  <td>Digital Copy</td>
  <td>25 USD</td>
  <td>Digitized version (scan it in, clean it up, and make it available to print)</td>
</tr>


<tr>
  <td>Parchment Printout</td>
  <td>25 USD</td>
  <td>8x11 Cotton Parchment either White or Aged. This requires digital cleanup of the pencil/pen work. Please let me know if you want the pages folded like a page or just a full 8x11 </td>
