## Commissions

Would you like a custom spellbook page for your story or character? These page fragments are great props for fantasy rpg games or even Call of Cthulhu ones where the Necronomicon is concerned. 

Example from a client's book

![Desktop View](/images/commissions/Julianna-Rest-Giver/full.png){: width="872"  }

The client found me through Instagram, and through some messages, we communicated an idea of what he was aiming for, what he wanted, and generally just bounced ideas back and forth on what kind of spellbook page to make

## How to Contact

DM me on Instagram! Or Linkedin if you like. I suppose I also have my business account at archives@technomancer-01.com for now.
