## General Announcement

Hello World!

Some of you may have noticed a few changes around here, and that is me attempting to clean this place up so that it can be a proper static site. The focus being on markdown file format instead of messing around with css. 

The big things here is my general Soulsborne Page is getting a bit of a face lift, mainly the pages were getting very clunky and hard to load. I've updated this to be less of an image-hosting website with only a preview of content and the main content being on Scavengers-Repo.com to sit alongside my other technical notes

Things to complete moving forward

- SQL Database for all materials, links and images
- Properly archive things
