## 02 Flour
````
>>> If the bag of flour is 5 pounds, and I bought the bag of flour for 3 dollars, how many dollars is a cup of flour?

Great! To find out how much a cup of flour costs, we need to know the weight of a cup of flour. One cup of all-purpose flour weighs approximately 120 grams.

So, if the bag of flour weighs 5 pounds (which is equal to 5 x 453.6 grams), and you bought the bag for $3, you can calculate the cost of a cup of
 flour as follows:

Cost of a cup of flour = Total cost of the bag of flour / Weight of a cup of flour
= $3 / 120 grams
= $0.025 per gram

Therefore, the cost of a cup of flour is $0.025 per gram. Since there are 120 grams in a cup, you can multiply the cost per gram by 120 to find the cost of a cup of flour:

Cost of a cup of flour = $0.025 per gram x 120 grams/cup
= $3 per cup

So, if the bag of flour is 5 pounds, then the cost of a cup of flour is $3 per cup.
