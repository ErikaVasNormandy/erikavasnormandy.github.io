<p>I hope this won’t become a curse. This year had its ups and downs (yay roaring 20s). I  am surprised and flattered at how much my Saturday Mornin Soulsborne/Sketching/Scribbles/Scrawling you all seem to enjoy so much, particularly when I don’t have many artsy people in my immediate circles and colleagues. 
</p>
<p>I suppose we can all agree to really enjoy how vivid the Elden Ring and Bloodborne worlds are (although my personal #1 is actually Sekiro haha). I'm not too sure who the people are that "follow" me, and it always feels a little weird fixating on that kind of stuff although the analytical part of me certainly does that. I appreciate y'all tossing me the likes 'n views my way; I've always drawn or at least doodled in the margins of my notes, but I feel like for the first time since I actually rally started drawing "pro", people have really started take my art-side more seriously. 
<br>
<br>
I have some plans, I already have a few pieces that I've printed out in digital form. I'm making a font that I can properly customize since I feel like this was part of the charm of a lot of these pieces. I guess I technically have a lot of these on <strong><a href= "https://www.redbubble.com/people/Technomancer-01">Redbubble</a></strong>, but huzzah! I've taken a leap and started an  <strong><a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Technomancer01">Etsy</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://ko-fi.com/technomancer_01">Ko-Fi</a></strong>!
<br>
<br>
Alright, so Etsy shop, cyber notes, stickers, webcomic, Code for San Jose, gaming, cosplay, sigh it's a lot. I'll figure it out though.
