## Godfrey, First Elden Lord
### (pages 8-9)

> "Then, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed. Return to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring. Grow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord. Lord Godfrey."

>  When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was robbed of his grace, becoming Tarnished, he took with him his kinfolk and left the Lands Between. After the Long March of the Tarnished came to an end, Godfrey divested himself of kingship, becoming a simple warrior once more.

> After killing the great red bear in a blood-soaked bout, he became fascinated by the untainted glory of its naked strength. "I wish to be a bear, no more, and no less.

> Brave Tarnished. Mighty warriors, who fought at my side.
Await the summons. It will call to thee one day.
Heed the fading grace. Listen to the Fingers.
Gold commandeth the very stars,
giving life its fullest brilliance.
Elden Ring, O, Elden Ring.
Be ready, once it is shattered.
Seek the Elden Ring, O Tarnished.
Across the Sea of Fog, to the Lands Between.
Become Lord. Enact thy will!
