Some ClipStudio practice with Horizon Zero Dawn. I have to admit I dislike the additional learning curve/workflow with Clipstudio but somehow it just looks a whole lot better for a shorter amount of time put in. Lineart wise for sure I like it a lot more although the simplicity of Procreate is keeping me on the fence unless if I just want to do lineart in ClipStudio

<p>Here is me fiddling around with it in Procreate after exporting it. Thankfully I'd just taken a screenshot since it doesn't save without the subscription
