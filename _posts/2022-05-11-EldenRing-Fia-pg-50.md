## Quotes
> Great champion, would you allow me to hold you, but briefly?
Perhaps you might share with me some of your lifely vigour, and your stout-heartedness.

> Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion. And you, I am sure, will bear a baldachin's blessing.

<img class="imageDisplay" src="/images/satmorningsoulsborne/EldenRing-pg50-Fia/EldenRing-pg50-fia-4.png" onclick="myFunction(this);">

> Do you think it vulgar, perhaps? Where I come from, it is a sacred act.

<img class="imageDisplay" src="/images/satmorningsoulsborne/EldenRing-pg50-Fia/EldenRing-pg50-fia-3.png" onclick="myFunction(this);">

> I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from. Afer I received the warmth and lifely vigour from a number o champions,

> I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life. To do so is the purpose of my being.

> But before I could bear the noble into new life, I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.

> Pray, be kind. Despite all that, I still wish to be Deathbed Companion.
So please, let me hold you like this, as often as it takes.
