<img style="object-fit:contain;

Primarily for stickers and totes. I find Redbubble to be the easiest way to distribute stickers without having to sink a ton into overhead and get a bunch of stickers without knowing how much peopel want them. I do find it to be less charming though, hence the Etsy and KoFi options

<h3>  <a href = "https://www.etsy.com/shop/Technomancer01">Etsy</a> </h3> 
I do have a few stickers here but also more higher quality art prints. I'll also be putting up my spellbook fragments up here soon and any potential leatherbound journals themselves : ).
