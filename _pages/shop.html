<p>
Welcome, seeker of arcane knowledge... Come trade in our wandering emporium 
in cyberspace. Be you Tarnished, Hunter, or Chosen Undead, 
I hope these wares will be of great use to you on your travails. 
</p>
<p>I sell spellbooks, specifically tomes that function as journals where each page is chock full of illustrations. It's a personal thing really; I often find myself bored when poring over the vast quanties of records and papers that the previous Archivist has built up over the centuries. 
They're from my own journeys, whether it's the Lands Between or Yharnam's streets. I find notes without pictures tedious, so I figured, why not have a journal already filled with pictures?
</p>

<p>These spellbooks are leatherbound by hand, and organized according to size and whether they are from Bloodborne or Elden Ring for now. There are 3 types:

<ul>
  <li>Mini</li>
  <li>Medium</li>
  <li>Big Book</li>
</ul>
</p>




<h4>Mini Book</h4>
<i>Use for times when one cannot bring a bigger book but needs written insight</i>

<p></p>

Dimensions: 2x3 inches 
Page Count: Roughly 60 sheets, aka 120 pages, more or less but with guaranteed illustrations on each page plus space to write. 

These books can come in a variety of colors, usually Bloodborne is a Black and Silver combination while my Elden Ring version is a medieval Brown and Gold

I use these for putting in my sidebag so I don't have to carry a book around with me in my hands

<p>Stickers n' things. Long ago I thought it'd be neat to make stickers at home but then I realized that was going to be rather difficult with the current setup of my living space. Please feel free to browse around here for even my non-Soulsborne oriented works.

Should you wish to simply toss a coin to your Hunter, I am here. These are all my links and while I do not think I am big enough to have impersonators I suppose you never know.
