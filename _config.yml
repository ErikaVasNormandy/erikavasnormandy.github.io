# In addition to these settings, there is a file _data/tokens-template.yml
# that you'll want to customize for your site. It's named 'tokens' because
# that was it's original purpose, but because tokens.yml is .gitexcluded, it's
# a good place to store your site-specific data that you'd rather not have
# forked or cloned. Of course, that means you'd want to back it up elsewhere.

# Also, for your post bylines, add author info for yourself in `_data/authors.yml`.
# (Using that method instead of site.owner, in case your posts get cloned with your repo.)

  # text: "I am Erika Hudiono, an illustrator, programmer, and webcomic author. 
  #By day, I help secure web traffic at NASA as a security engineer. Off the clock, I illustrate the Cybernomicon, a collection of
  # various infosec and tech-related notes decorated with my Saturday Morning Soulsborne drawings to make some pretty dry 
  #content more exciting. \n\nI've used it as a way to organize my various technical hobbies, from cybersecurity, to software 
  #engineering, and even some of my HAM Radio attempts make it in. If they're willing to learn, tech should be accessible to 
  #more people, even if they don't fall in a neat silo of what people usually think of."

# and full paths of the various OSes in compose.rb. For my Windows
# environment, I just put a subl.cmd file in my PATH that points to the full
# path to Sublime's subl.exe.) Also, put your most common post extension.
