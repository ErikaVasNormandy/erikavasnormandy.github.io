# technomancer-01.com

A personal site derived from arkadianriver.com and by extension the talented [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn) via http://html5up.net/spectral
Originally this was scavengers-repo, but the upkeep was starting to get in the way and I mainly wanted to focus on art stuff and cyber. 

## Some Notes for Future Me
```
Make sure you keep the CNAME file in mind

bundle init

bundle install

bundle add jekyll 


(you might need to install the individual components)
bundle exec jekyll serve

_site stuff gets replaced
_config.yml is the most important aspect


```
#### Running on Ubuntu
sudo apt install ruby-full

main.scss is where you can actually change the font color of things
      a {
         color: white;
         text-decoration: none;
      }
   }
 
1. Personalize the images with your own, and change the attribution for your new banner
   at the bottom of `_data/credits.yml`.

   Image | Description
   ------|------------
   **`banner.jpg`** | The main large image on the front page
   **`pic01.jpg`** | The topics image
   **`pic02.jpg`** | The works image

1. From the repo's root directory, start Jekyll to preview as you write.
   
   ```
    --future --drafts
   ```
      
1. Open a browser to http://localhost:4000 (or the port number that jekyll indicates to open).


1. Compose your first post!

   ```
   ruby compose.rb
   ```
